# Unlimited Random User

This is a simple script for creating unlimited random user.

### Why should you use it?
randomuser.me is a simple API for getting random datas about a user (not fictive).
The API is only responding 5 different users at one request.
But i believe, i can't be the only one, who needs more, than just 5 at same time.
So i started developing this simple script, for calling the API and inserting every user i recive in the database.

For a better overview i implement a simple search and stat modal based on twitter bootstrap.
Feel free to edit the view - i am not able to creating good views ;)

## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Database
Create a database, and fill the "config.php" with your creditinals.

### 1.2 Table (SQL FILE)
Import the user.sql in your database

This should do the magic.
